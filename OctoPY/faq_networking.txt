Q: How can I connect to eduroam command line style (network-manager disabled) ?

A:
First edit /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf :
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
        ssid="eduroam"
        proto=WPA2
        scan_ssid=1
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        eap=PEAP
        pairwise=CCMP
        anonymous_identity="anonymous@upmc.fr"
        identity="MAIL@upmc.fr"
        password="PASSWORD"
        phase1="peaplabel=0"
        phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
        priority=2
}

Then: sudo wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dwext -B
Finally: sudo dhclient wlan0

Please be aware that you wireless interface may differ from "wlan0" (for example "eth1"). You may run the following command to find your wireless interface:
sudo lshw -C network

Q: How can I share my wireless internet access through a wire connection ?

A:
On the host accessing the internet by wireless connection:
First configure the dhcp server. You may need to install isc-dhcp-server.
Edit the file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf (I advise you to create a backup of this file) to add the following lines:

option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	# This is the range of IP provided by this DHCP
	range 192.168.0.110 192.168.0.150;
	option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
	# This should be the IP of the host connected to the internet on your network
	option routers 192.168.0.210;
}


Then edit /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server.conf (do a backup) to add the line:
# This should be the interface with which this host is connected to the access point
# More generally, this line specifies on which interface will the DHCP server listen to DHCP requests
INTERFACES="eth0"


Edit /etc/network/interfaces:
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# These lines are used to connect to a wireless network specified in /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf (see previous question)
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-driver wext
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf


iface eth0 inet static
# This address can be changed
address 192.168.0.210
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 134.157.249.254
pre-up /sbin/iptables-restore /etc/network/iptables

The address of the gateway is very important. It needs to be the IP of the next router used to access the internet. To find it, type 'route -n' and look for the line where 'Flags' are set to 'UG'


You then need to set the IP tables. They are used to forward the packets through your gateway. Type:
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/network/iptables


You have now to enable routing. Type the command:
sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"

And then edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf and uncomment the line:
#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 (just remove the '#')


Finally you need to restart the networking. Some of these commands may not work so this part might need some reworking!
sudo ifdown eth0
sudo ifdown wlan0
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
sudo ifup wlan0
sudo ifup eth0
sudo /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server start


Now on to the client host, with a wireless connection to the private network (don't worry we're almost done)! Here is the /etc/network/interfaces file used:
auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa-supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp

And the wpa_supplicant.conf:
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
        ssid="NETGEAR_11ng"
        proto=WPA
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        pairwise=TKIP
        #psk="rpiaccesspoint"
        psk=e0ff62c4540be5be2107a1cb97e9852546316f016a05ef3ae6f7a230f8973aed
        priority=1
}

Please note that the "#psk" line is commented and not necessary. I only left it so that there is a trace of the passphrase which is used to obtained the real psk by doing the following command: 
wpa_passphrase NETGEAR_11ng rpiaccesspoint (which returns the psk above)

Then simply do:
# Not necessary if wlan0 is not already configured (but it can't hurt to be careful)
sudo ifdown wlan0
sudo ifup wlan0

Some lines in this fashion can appear:
ioctl[SIOCSIWAP]: Operation not permitted
ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Invalid argument
ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Invalid argument

Don't worry, it should work anyway.

If everything works, the rpi should get an IP on the NETGEAR network provided by the DHCP server on the wired PC. Consequently, it should be able to connect to the internet. Verify it first by doing:
# This is the IP for ubuntu.com
ping 91.189.94.40

Then try:
ping ubuntu.com

It can take some time but if it doesn't work, you may have a DNS problem. Install resolvconf :
sudo apt-get install resolvconf

And then modify the file /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf to have the following line:
# openDNS servers
prepend domain-name-servesr 208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220;

It now should work (after ifdown/ifup wlan0) !
